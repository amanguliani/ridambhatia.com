									April 2013 Manraj and family shifted to Mukilteo and Nani planned to stay with them till middle of June.
									Nani was in the habit of taking out her pair of ear studs at night and placing it on the side table.</p>
								<p>
									One fine morning when Manraj went out for grocery shopping and Ridam was at home with Nani, she noticed that the pair of studs was missing from the side table.
									She was really worried, as it was of gold and diamond, and quite expensive.
									She somehow had this intuition that it could be Ridam who must have taken it.
									She very sweetly questioned Ridam whether he has picked it up.
									Yes came the answer with the same sweetness.
									Then where have you kept it was Nani's next question. 'In the hole' promptly answered Ridam.
									Nani tried to find out few more details about the hole, but to her astonishment Ridam stuck to his answer, 'In the hole'.</p>
								<p>
									Nani practically searched all the holes in the house.
									Even the drain pipes of kitchen and bathrooms were not spared.
									Nani was really upset to loose her precious jewellery.
									When Manraj returned from the market, she confronted Ridam and asked him to take to the hole in which he has put the ear studs.
									Ridam took Manraj to the closet in which a shoe rack with plastic pipes was lying. Ridam had put the studs into the open hole of one of the pipes.
									Manraj finally dismantled the rack and took out Nani's pair of ear studs.

									June 29th 2013, Aman was getting married to Nidhi in New Jersey city.
									Lots of preparations and arrangements were required. Aman was all alone there.
									Sanjeev and Juhi were helping him in making arrangements.</p>
								<p>
									Manraj, Ridam and Nani decided to reach Jersey well in advance, to help Aman in planning finer details of the function.
									On landing at the airport Ridam was amused to see Aman Mamu's new Honda Accord Car which had a screen in front, showing back of the car, to help driver make a smooth parking.
									It was a fascinating thing for Ridam as he saw this feature in a car for the first time.
									He called it 'Parking Lot'(could not pronounce lot properly and sounded very cute to say lot). </p>
								<p>
									Now for him it was a craze to insist every morning to have a ride in a car which has parking lot.
									We all thoroughly enjoyed his observation and  inquisitiveness to learn new technology.

								<p>
									Nanu while travelling from India to New Jersey, was in transit at one of the Switzerland airports.
									He picked up a beautiful chocolate packing from the duty free shop, as Switzerland chocolates are considered to be the best in the world.
									Ridam loved those chocolates. </p>
								<p>
									Manraj wanted to control Ridam's sugar intake so she strictly instructed him not to eat more than one chocolate in a day.
									Then one fine morning we all saw Ridam playing with Nidhi's BMW car key, and when she had to go out, the key was no where to be seen.
									We all searched it up and down but could not find it. Ridam too was questioned many times but he kept mum giving a naughty smile. </p>
								<p>
									Nani thought of applying her old theory of reward Psychology.
									She offered Ridam his favourite chocolate, if he could give any clue to the car key.
									Ridam stared at Nani, thought for a moment and replied, "I don't eat two chocolates in a day".
									Nani was speechless. She accepted her defeat and acknowledged that her Psychology can not be implemented to this child belonging to generation 'Z'.

								<p>
									In his early years of childhood Ridam ate poorly and was always under weight.
									Manraj was concerned about his health and tried to find out new ways to feed him.
									To provide him with a protein rich food, she introduced Paneer paranthi and it was a hit.
									Ridam loved eating it with home made yoghurt or dahi.
									Manraj added a pinch of ajwain to make it tasty and digestive.
								</p>
								<p>
									Being a smart child he observed Manraj making paneer paranthi and learnt the entire process.
									Whenever he felt hunger pangs, he repeated the entire recipe, with all small rituals to be followed religiously.
									Aman Mamu's wedding time he would call Nani to accompany him to the kitchen, and here goes Ridam's narration of paneer Paranthi recipe.
								</p>
								<p>
									Come on Nani...lets make peer paunthi(paneer paranthi) gila atta lao, suka atta lao, peer lao, takla lao, belna lao(rolling board and rolling pin), jain(ajwain) lao, give me jain to taste(this was a ritual to taste a pinch of ajwain whenever we made paneer paranthi).
									It was a great fun for the family to watch little Ridam making dough and rolling roti.

								<p>
									Ridam's transition from story listening to story reading was really smooth and fast.
									Year 2013 when the entire family gathered in New Jersey for Aman's wedding, little Ridam loved to listen to all the incidents, which occurred in any one of our lives.</p>
								<p>
									The narration needed to be interesting and with finer details.
									Ridam learnt the sequence of the incident very quickly and wanted it be repeated in the same manner every time.
									Few interesting  hit 'tories' (stories) were when Aman Mamu burnt his finger while helping Nidhi Mami in the kitchen and when Nani had to buy a cup of coffee from Addis Ababa airport and exchanged one US dollar into Ethiopian Birr.
									Both the stories were repeated many many times every day.</p>
								<p>
									As I have mentioned in my previous episodes that Ridam was more for mental food than any thing to be consumed orally.
									His famous slogan 'tory sunao' was very popular in the family.
