								<p>November 2011. Ridam and Manraj were visiting India. Ajit had to join them after a fortnight.
									Nanu wanted to celebrate Ridam's 2nd birthday in Delhi.
									Many of  Nani Nanu's friends were eager to meet their first grandchild.
									4th evening a function was organised in the CSOI, a club for officers, of which Nanu was a member.
									Same day early in the  morning Nani thought of taking Ridam to Bangla Sahib Gurudwara for Babaji's blessings.
									Kushal Pal who was Nani's driver was asked to drive us to the Gurudwara.
									Ridam was very happy that he could sit at the back seat in between Nani and Mumma without any hassle of car seat and belt.
									Laws in India are not enforced as strictly as in US.</p>

								<p>On their way to Gurudwara Nani thought of teaching Ridam a poem 'found a pea nut' and to her astonishment 22 kilometres of journey from Dwarka to Gurudwara Bangla Sahib she was asked to repeat the poem ,'N' number of times.
									The moment Nani stopped, Ridam requested 'Nani fir se' and it went on and on.
									By the time they reached Gurudwara Ridam was well versed with the Poem.
									Kushal Pal who observed Nani in school every day knew that perhaps it was the first time she repeated anything so many times.
									The teacher in Nani was happy to see little Ridam so passionate for learning. </p>

								<p>For evening party preparations were done with white and blue balloons, a cake of Ridam's liking and music.
									Manraj very enthusiastically selected a long list of songs which were appropriate to Birthday celebration.
									As the crowd was going to be a mixed one, some invitees from Nanu Nani's friend circle and some from Manraj's friends, she included few songs which could be liked by all.</p>

								<p>Our family reached 15 minutes prior to the guests coming in.
									Weather was pleasant that evening, but Manraj made Ridam wear a tuxedo jacket to protect him from late evening chill.
									Looking dashing all dressed up, he liked the beautiful surroundings and elevated bridges of the club garden, where the party was being hosted.
									Families started coming in with few small children of Ridam's age too. Ridam got engrossed playing with them. </p>

								<p>Suddenly the music man played first song 'aao ji ji aaen nu'.
									Little Ridam for a moment listened to the song and started moving towards the person who was playing the music.
									With great difficulty he climbed the chair lying near by and made himself seated over it.
									As per the program next song was related to Birthday celebration but Ridam insisted to stop that song and repeat aao ji again and again.
									2 to 3 hours of party time and the song got played non stop. </p>

								<p>After great insistence Manraj made Ridam get up from that chair and cut the cake.
									Song was of course a great hit and popular with the people present.
									It was in great demand even after a long time.</p>

								<p>Coming back from India, a big surprise awaited Ridam.
									Ajit got a job in Boeing Philadelphia. Company not only offered a high position, big pay package but complete relocation from Ohio to Philly.
									Manraj also talked to her advisor that now she will pursue her Phd program remotely.</p>

								<p>The movers and packers performed their work well. The Entire house hold and family got relocated to Philly.
									Ridam along with his Mumma Papa checked into a temporary accommodation given by Boeing.
									It was a suite in a hotel. Ajit joined his office and started his search for a house on rent.
									Aman and Nidhi planned a visit to Philly and to have some fun moments with Ridam.</p>

								<p>Hotel room had plush beds and many pillows with each bed.
									To play with and lie down between two pillows was Ridam's favourite pass time.
									Ridam made a sandwich of himself lying between the pillows.
									Nidhi and Aman enjoyed his game by repeating the act again and again.
									Whenever this act was narrated later on it brought a smile on everyone's face. </p>

								<p>May 2012, Nani Nanu planned a visit to Philadelphia to meet little Ridam.
									Nanu as usual had some official commitment, so he asked Nani to travel alone and promised that he will reach there a week later.
									Nani started purchasing small gifts for little Ridam.
									She went to Karol Bagh market to buy colored pencils, pencil box, tiffin box and water bottle for her darling grandchild.
									The shop keeper offered many beautiful products with latest cartoon characters.
									Though Nani did not know much about the trend but on another customer's recommendation she bought a blue water bottle for Ridam.</p>

								<p>Ajit, Manraj and Nidhi, who was an undergraduate student at Rutgers were on the airport to receive Nani.
									Reaching home Nani opened her bags and gave all the small things she brought for Ridam.
									Philadelphia house had bed rooms upstairs and living dining at ground level.
									Same afternoon when Nani was sitting in the living room, she saw little Ridam coming down holding water bottle in his hand and repeating these words again and again 'Meri Nani India se mere liye blue bottle le ke aa gayi hai' Nani was overwhelmed to see this sight.

								<p>An year spent in Boeing Philadelphia, working on aircraft's being manufactured for US Airforce, Ajit decided to move to west coast for better opportunities.
									He applied for a position in Boeing located in Everett Seattle. This unit produced passenger planes.
									His Request was accepted and the family got relocated to Mukilteo, WA</p>

								<p>Very close to their house lived family of Sunder Singh who also worked for Boeing.
									Ridam got along well with Vedansh who was of the same age as Ridam.
									Three years old Ridam loved exploring and learning new things.
									His latest passion was to auto lock doors from inside and then to open it.
									Many of the times it happened that Ridam auto closed the door and Ajit opened it with a screwdriver.</p>

								<p>One fine evening when both the families were dining at Sunder Singh's house, Ridam auto locked the door with Vedansh inside.
									Poor boy cried bitterly but could not open the door.
									Finally Ajit came for his rescue with the tool box kept in the car for such emergencies.
									Nani was an eye witness to the entire episode as she was there those days.
									She still remembers the naughty smile on Ridam's face when Vedansh was screaming for help.
